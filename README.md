# NSUEM Gschedule

This is a Python-based web app for NSUEM students (and maybe teachers). You specify your group name, and it parses your group schedule for a semester from [rasp.nsuem.ru](http:\\rasp.nsuem.ru) and pushes it to your Google Calendar as a new calendar.

This is my first Python project (or indeed my first serious project ever). It may contain some bad codestyle and idiotic code. If you see some - don't be afraid to contact me and express your feelings :)
